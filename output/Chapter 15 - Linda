Linda is a bright, articulate, and successful woman. She is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.

Kahneman introduces the Linda problem to illustrate how people can be misled by their intuitions when they are asked to make judgments about probability. The Linda problem asks people to consider the following statement: "Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement." People are then asked which is more probable: (1) Linda is a bank teller or (2) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

Most people answer that the second option is more likely, because it seems to add information. However, Kahneman explains that this is not the case. He argues that the two statements are logically equivalent, so the probability of both being true is the same. In other words, the second statement does not add any additional information.

Kahneman goes on to explain that the reason people get the Linda problem wrong is because of the way our brains process information. We tend to focus on the most salient information, which in this case is the fact that Linda is active in the feminist movement. This leads us to overlook the fact that the two statements are logically equivalent.

Kahneman concludes by noting that the Linda problem illustrates how our intuitions can lead us astray when we are making judgments about probability. He argues that it is important to be aware of our cognitive biases and to use logical reasoning when making decisions.
