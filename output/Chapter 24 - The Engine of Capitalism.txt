Engine of Capitalism is a chapter from Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. It focuses on the idea that the capitalist system is driven by the decisions of individuals. It argues that the decisions of individuals are shaped by their cognitive biases, which in turn shape the capitalist system. The chapter examines the role of cognitive biases in decision-making, and how they can lead to irrational decisions that are detrimental to the capitalist system. It also looks at how these biases can be managed and how they can be used to create a more efficient and equitable capitalist system. The chapter also discusses the role of emotions in decision-making, and how they can be used to make better decisions. Finally, it looks at how the capitalist system can be improved by taking into account the cognitive biases of individuals. By understanding the cognitive biases of individuals, and how they shape their decisions, the capitalist system can be improved to create a more efficient and equitable system.
