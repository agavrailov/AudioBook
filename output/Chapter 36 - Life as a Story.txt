Life as a Story of Thinking, Fast and Slow:

We all make decisions and judgments every day, and the way we do this can be divided into two distinct systems. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; it operates automatically and with little or no effort. System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical; it requires attention and conscious control.

System 1 is the dominant system in our lives, and it is responsible for most of our decisions and judgments. It is also the source of many of our mistakes. System 2 is the more reliable system, but it is often overwhelmed by System 1.

The two systems interact in complex ways. System 1 can influence System 2, and System 2 can influence System 1. This means that our decisions and judgments can be influenced by both systems.

We can use System 2 to help us make better decisions and judgments. We can learn to recognize when System 1 is leading us astray and to override it with System 2. We can also use System 2 to help us understand the biases and errors of System 1.

By understanding the two systems, we can become more aware of our decisions and judgments and more able to make better ones. We can also become more aware of the biases and errors that can lead us astray. Ultimately, this understanding can help us make better decisions and judgments in our lives.
