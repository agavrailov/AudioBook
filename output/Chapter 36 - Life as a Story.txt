Welcome to Chapter The Characters of the Story of Thinking, Fast and Slow. In this chapter, Daniel Kahneman introduces two characters that represent two different systems of thinking. 

The first character is System 1, which is fast, instinctive and emotional. It operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 1 is responsible for snap judgments, gut feelings and the recognition of patterns. 

The second character is System 2, which is slower, more deliberative and more logical. It allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. System 2 is responsible for effortful problem solving and concentration. 

Kahneman also explains that System 1 and System 2 are not completely independent of one another. System 1 can trigger System 2, and System 2 can control System 1. He also explains that System 1 can be trained, and that System 2 can be improved with practice. 

Finally, Kahneman explains that System 1 and System 2 are both necessary for making decisions. System 1 is important for quickly recognizing patterns and making snap judgments, while System 2 is important for making more deliberate decisions and solving complex problems. 

So, to summarize, in this chapter, Daniel Kahneman introduces two characters that represent two different systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, instinctive and emotional, while System 2 is slower, more deliberative and more logical. Both systems are necessary for making decisions, and they can interact with one another.
