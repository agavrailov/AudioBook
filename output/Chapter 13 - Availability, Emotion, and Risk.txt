Chapter Availability, Emotion, and Risk of Thinking, Fast and Slow: This chapter explores the idea that people often rely on mental shortcuts, known as heuristics, to make decisions. Heuristics are based on the availability of information and the emotions associated with it. The availability of information is determined by how easily it can be recalled or imagined. Emotions can influence decisions by making certain options appear more attractive than others. Additionally, people often take risks when making decisions, which can lead to poor outcomes. The chapter also discusses how people can use System 2 thinking to make more informed decisions. System 2 thinking involves taking the time to carefully consider all the available information and making a decision based on that. By using System 2 thinking, people can make more informed decisions and reduce the risk of making poor decisions.
