Chapter The Lazy Controller

The “Lazy Controller” is a concept introduced by Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. It is the idea that our brains have two systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is the fast, intuitive, and effortless thinking that we do automatically. System 2 is the slower, more deliberate, and more conscious thinking we do when we need to focus and make decisions.

The Lazy Controller is the idea that System 1 is the default system of thinking and that System 2 only kicks in when it is absolutely necessary. This means that our brains are wired to take the path of least resistance and to conserve energy whenever possible. As a result, we often make decisions without really thinking them through or considering all the options. 

For example, when we are presented with a choice between two options, our brains will often take the easier option without really considering the consequences. We might choose the option that requires less effort or the one that we are most familiar with. We might also be influenced by our emotions or past experiences. 

The Lazy Controller can also lead us to make decisions that are not in our best interest. For example, we might choose to eat unhealthy food because it is convenient or because it tastes good. We might also choose to procrastinate on important tasks because it is easier than doing the work. 

The Lazy Controller can be a powerful force in our lives, but it is important to be aware of it and to make conscious decisions when necessary. By being mindful of our choices and taking the time to think through our decisions, we can make better choices and avoid the pitfalls of the Lazy Controller.
