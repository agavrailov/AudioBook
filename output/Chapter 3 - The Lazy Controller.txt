The Lazy Controller of Thinking, Fast and Slow is a chapter from Daniel Kahneman's book about the two systems of thinking. The first system is fast, intuitive, and emotional, while the second is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The chapter focuses on the role of the "lazy controller," which is the part of the brain that decides which system of thinking to use. The lazy controller is lazy because it prefers to rely on the fast system of thinking, even when the slower system might be more appropriate. This can lead to mistakes, as the fast system is prone to biases and errors. The chapter also discusses how the lazy controller can be trained to make better decisions, such as by using cognitive biases to our advantage. Finally, the chapter looks at how the lazy controller can be influenced by external factors, such as the environment and the people around us. By understanding the lazy controller, we can better understand our own thought processes and make better decisions.
