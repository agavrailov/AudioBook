Chapter Answering an Easier Question

Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you were asked a difficult question and instead of answering it, you chose to answer an easier one? This is something that happens more often than we think. In this chapter, we will explore why this happens and how it affects our decision-making process.

One example of this phenomenon is when people are asked to make a difficult decision, such as choosing between two job offers. Instead of making a decision based on the facts, they often choose the job that is easier to explain or the one that has a better reputation. This is because it is easier to answer the easier question than the difficult one.

Another example is when people are asked to make a decision about a complex problem. Instead of trying to solve the problem, they often choose to answer an easier question. For example, if someone is asked to decide whether or not to invest in a certain stock, they may choose to answer the easier question of whether or not the stock is popular.

The problem with this type of decision-making is that it can lead to poor decisions. When people focus on answering the easier question, they often overlook important details and fail to consider the consequences of their decisions. This can lead to costly mistakes.

To avoid this type of mistake, it is important to focus on the difficult question and consider all the facts before making a decision. This will help ensure that the decision is based on the best available information and that it is the right one for the situation.
