The Characters of Thinking, Fast and Slow

In this chapter, I introduce two characters that are the protagonists of this book: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; it operates automatically and with little or no effort. System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical; it allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The interactions of these two systems are the basis of the dual-process theory of the mind.

System 1 is responsible for the quick judgments and impressions that often turn out to be as good as, or even better than, the conclusions of careful reasoning. System 1 runs automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 1 is also the source of the impulses and feelings that are the basis of spontaneous decisions.

System 2 is the conscious, reasoning self that has beliefs, makes choices, and decides what to think about and what to do. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. It is responsible for effortful problem solving, but it can also be responsible for slow, effortful, logical analysis of situations that System 1 understands quickly.

The interactions of these two systems are the basis of the dual-process theory of the mind. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification.

In summary, this chapter introduces the two characters of Thinking, Fast and Slow: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional, while System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The interactions of these two systems are the basis of the dual-process theory of the mind. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2, which are then adopted with little or no modification.
