Chapter The Fourfold Pattern

We all have two systems of thought, which Daniel Kahneman calls System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. 

Kahneman explains that these two systems interact in a four-fold pattern. System 1 is constantly generating impressions and feelings that are the basis for System 2's decisions. System 2 then evaluates the evidence and decides whether to accept or reject the initial impression. 

For example, when we encounter a new situation, System 1 quickly forms an impression based on past experiences. System 2 then evaluates the evidence and decides whether to accept or reject the initial impression. If System 2 finds the evidence convincing, it will accept the impression and take action. 

Kahneman also explains that System 1 is prone to errors. It can be influenced by bias, stereotypes, and other cognitive biases. System 2 can help us avoid these errors by evaluating the evidence and making more informed decisions. 

Kahneman also explains that System 1 and System 2 can work together to make better decisions. System 1 can provide the initial impression, while System 2 can evaluate the evidence and make a more informed decision. This four-fold pattern of thinking can help us make better decisions and avoid errors.
