Experienced Well-Being of Thinking, Fast and Slow:

The concept of experienced well-being is explored in this chapter, which is the subjective evaluation of one's life. This evaluation is based on the emotional quality of the experiences that one has had over a certain period of time. It is distinct from the concept of life satisfaction, which is an overall assessment of one's life.

The chapter looks at the relationship between experienced well-being and the two systems of thinking: System 1, which is fast and intuitive, and System 2, which is slow and deliberate. It is argued that System 1 is more important for experienced well-being than System 2. This is because System 1 is responsible for the automatic evaluation of experiences, which is the basis of experienced well-being. System 2, on the other hand, is more important for life satisfaction.

The chapter also looks at the role of memory in experienced well-being. It is argued that the memories of positive experiences are more likely to be remembered than the memories of negative experiences. This means that people tend to have a more positive view of their lives than is actually the case.

Finally, the chapter looks at the impact of the environment on experienced well-being. It is argued that people's well-being is affected by their environment, with those living in more affluent areas tending to have higher levels of experienced well-being. It is also argued that people's well-being can be improved by making changes to their environment, such as improving their living conditions.
