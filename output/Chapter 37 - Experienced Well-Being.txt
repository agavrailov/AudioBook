We all have experienced moments of joy, contentment, and satisfaction. But what is it that makes us feel this way? According to Daniel Kahneman, it is the concept of experienced well-being. Experienced well-being is the feeling of pleasure, contentment, and satisfaction that comes from engaging in activities that we enjoy. 

Kahneman explains that experienced well-being is a subjective experience that is based on our individual preferences. For example, some people may find pleasure in reading a book while others may find pleasure in playing a sport. The key is to find activities that bring us joy and satisfaction. 

Kahneman also explains that experienced well-being is not just about pleasure, but also about contentment. Contentment is the feeling of satisfaction that comes from engaging in activities that are meaningful to us. For example, a person may find contentment in volunteering at a local soup kitchen or in spending time with their family. 

Kahneman also explains that experienced well-being is not just about pleasure and contentment, but also about satisfaction. Satisfaction is the feeling of accomplishment that comes from engaging in activities that are meaningful to us. For example, a person may find satisfaction in completing a difficult task or in achieving a goal. 

In conclusion, experienced well-being is the feeling of pleasure, contentment, and satisfaction that comes from engaging in activities that are meaningful to us. By finding activities that bring us joy and satisfaction, we can experience greater levels of experienced well-being.
