Welcome to the chapter "The Characters of the Story" of Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. 
In this chapter, Kahneman introduces two characters that represent the two systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, instinctive, and emotional. It is the automatic and effortless way of thinking. System 2 is slow, deliberative, and logical. It is the conscious and effortful way of thinking. 

Kahneman explains that System 1 is the dominant character in our lives. It is responsible for most of our decisions, judgments, and actions. System 2 is the lazy character; it is easily tired and easily distracted. System 2 is only engaged when it is necessary, such as when we are faced with difficult tasks or when we need to make important decisions. 

Kahneman also explains that System 1 is prone to errors and biases. It is influenced by our past experiences and our emotions. System 2 is more reliable and logical, but it is also limited by its lack of knowledge and its limited capacity. 

Kahneman argues that we should strive to use System 2 as much as possible, as it is more reliable and less prone to errors. He also argues that we should strive to be aware of the limitations of both systems and to recognize when one system is more appropriate than the other.
