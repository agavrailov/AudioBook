Causes Trump Statistics

In this chapter, I discuss how people often make decisions based on their gut feelings and intuition, rather than on the facts and figures. This is known as "causal thinking" and it can be very powerful. It is often more effective than relying solely on statistics, which can be misleading or incomplete.

I explain how people often make decisions based on a few key factors, such as the perceived importance of the issue or the perceived trustworthiness of the source. This is often done without considering the full range of data or the potential consequences of the decision.

I also discuss how people often rely on mental shortcuts and heuristics to make decisions. These mental shortcuts can be helpful in some cases, but they can also lead to errors and bad decisions.

Finally, I discuss how people can use causal thinking to make better decisions. I explain how it is important to consider the full range of data, to think critically about the potential consequences of a decision, and to be aware of the potential biases that may be influencing one's thinking.
