The Outside View

Have you ever been in a situation where you had to make a decision, but you didn't have enough information to make an informed decision? This is where the outside view can help. The outside view is a concept from the book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. It is a way of looking at a problem from an external perspective. 

The outside view encourages us to step back and look at the problem from a different angle. It helps us to see the bigger picture and gain a better understanding of the situation. By looking at the problem from an outside perspective, we can gain insight into the potential outcomes of our decisions. 

The outside view is based on the idea that we can learn from the experiences of others. We can use the experiences of others to inform our decisions and make better choices. For example, if you are considering investing in a new business venture, you can look at the success rate of similar businesses in the past to get an idea of how likely it is to succeed. 

The outside view also helps us to avoid making decisions based on our own biases. We can look at the problem objectively and make decisions based on facts rather than our own opinions. This can help us to make more informed decisions and avoid making mistakes. 

The outside view is a powerful tool that can be used to make better decisions and gain insight into potential outcomes. By looking at the problem from an outside perspective, we can gain a better understanding of the situation and make more informed decisions.
