Welcome to Chapter The Characters of the Story of Thinking, Fast and Slow. In this chapter, Daniel Kahneman introduces two characters that represent two different systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. 

System 1 is fast, automatic, effortless, associative, and emotional. It is the intuitive, automatic, and often unconscious way of thinking. System 1 is responsible for most of the decisions we make in our daily lives. 

System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. It is the conscious, effortful, and analytical way of thinking. System 2 is responsible for more complex decisions and problem-solving. 

Kahneman explains that System 1 is the source of many of our cognitive biases and errors. System 1 is prone to overconfidence, and it is easily influenced by our environment. System 2 is more reliable, but it is also more prone to fatigue and distraction. 

Kahneman also explains that System 1 and System 2 are not mutually exclusive. We use both systems in our daily lives, and they often interact with each other. For example, System 1 can provide us with useful information that can be used by System 2 to make more informed decisions. 

Finally, Kahneman explains that we can use System 2 to override System 1 and make better decisions. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both systems, we can become better decision-makers.
