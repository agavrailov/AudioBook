How Judgments Happen

We make judgments every day, but how do we come to these conclusions? The answer lies in two distinct systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. It is the source of our snap judgments, and it operates automatically and with little effort. System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. It is the source of our conscious decisions, and it requires effort and concentration.

System 1 is the first to respond when we are presented with a problem or decision. It is quick to make associations and draw conclusions based on past experiences. System 1 is also responsible for the biases and errors that can creep into our judgments. System 2 is the more logical, analytical system, and it is responsible for verifying the accuracy of System 1's conclusions.

When we are presented with a problem or decision, System 1 will quickly generate a response. System 2 will then take over and evaluate the response, checking for accuracy and consistency. If System 2 finds any errors or inconsistencies, it will adjust the response accordingly. This process of evaluation and adjustment is known as "second-level thinking."

Second-level thinking is essential for making accurate judgments. It allows us to recognize errors and adjust our responses accordingly. It also helps us to recognize when our initial response is based on emotion or bias, and to adjust it accordingly.

By understanding the two systems of thinking, we can better understand how judgments are formed and how to make more accurate decisions. System 1 is fast and intuitive, but it can be prone to errors. System 2 is slower and more analytical, but it can help us to recognize and correct errors. By combining the two systems, we can make better judgments and decisions.
