Welcome to the chapter 'The Characters of the Story' of Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. 

In this chapter, Kahneman introduces two characters that represent two distinct systems of thinking: System 1 and System 2. System 1 is fast, automatic, and emotional. It is the source of our intuition and is often the default mode of thinking. System 2 is slow, deliberate, and logical. It is the source of our conscious reasoning and requires effort to activate. 

Kahneman explains that System 1 is responsible for the majority of our decisions and that it is prone to errors due to its reliance on heuristics and biases. System 2 is more reliable, but it is also more difficult to access. 

Kahneman also explains that System 1 is capable of learning and can be trained to become more accurate. He suggests that we can use System 2 to monitor and correct the errors of System 1. 

Finally, Kahneman explains that the two systems of thinking are inextricably linked and that they must work together in order to make effective decisions. He argues that the best decisions are made when System 1 and System 2 are both engaged.
