The Science of Availability of Thinking, Fast and Slow: In this chapter, I explore the concept of availability, which is the ease with which a particular idea or image can be brought to mind. Availability is a key factor in how we make decisions and how we think about the world. I discuss the two systems of thinking that we use: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and emotional; and System 2, which is slow, deliberative, and logical. I explain how availability can lead to biases in our thinking, such as the availability heuristic, which is the tendency to overestimate the probability of an event based on how easily it can be recalled. I also discuss the impact of vividness on availability, and how this can lead to misjudgments. Finally, I discuss how availability can be used to make decisions, and how we can use it to our advantage.
