Chapter The Science of Availability

Have you ever found yourself making a decision based on the first thing that comes to mind? Or maybe you've heard someone else do the same? This is what is known as the availability heuristic, and it's something that we all do. The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that we use to make decisions quickly and easily. It's based on the idea that the more readily available information is, the more likely it is to be true. 

In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman explains the science behind the availability heuristic. He explains that when we make decisions, we often rely on the information that is most easily accessible. This means that we tend to rely on information that is recent, vivid, or memorable. For example, if you were asked to estimate the number of countries in the world, you might think of the most recent country you heard about in the news, or the most vivid country you've visited. 

Kahneman also explains that the availability heuristic can lead to bias and errors in judgement. He gives the example of a study where participants were asked to estimate the number of words they had read in a book. Those who had read a book with a particularly memorable scene estimated that they had read more words than those who had read a book with no memorable scenes. This shows that the availability heuristic can lead us to overestimate the importance of certain information. 

Kahneman also explains that the availability heuristic can lead us to make snap judgements without considering all the facts. He gives the example of a study where participants were asked to estimate the success rate of a medical procedure. Those who had heard of a successful case estimated that the procedure was more successful than those who had only heard of unsuccessful cases. This shows that the availability heuristic can lead us to make decisions based on incomplete information. 

Overall, the availability heuristic is a mental shortcut that we use to make decisions quickly and easily. However, it can lead to bias and errors in judgement if we don't consider all the facts.
