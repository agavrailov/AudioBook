Chapter Prospect Theory

Prospect theory is a behavioral economic theory that explains how people make decisions when faced with risk. It was developed by Nobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. The theory states that people are more likely to take risks when the potential reward is greater than the potential loss. 

The theory is based on the idea that people have an irrational fear of losses and an irrational desire for gains. People are more likely to take risks when the potential reward is greater than the potential loss, even if the potential loss is greater than the potential reward. For example, people may be willing to take a chance on a stock that has a 50% chance of doubling in value, even if it has a 50% chance of losing all of its value. 

Kahneman and Tversky also found that people are more likely to take risks when the potential reward is immediate, rather than delayed. This is because people tend to discount future rewards, meaning they value them less than immediate rewards. 

The theory also states that people are more likely to take risks when the potential losses are smaller than the potential rewards. For example, people may be more likely to invest in a stock that has a 50% chance of doubling in value and a 50% chance of losing 10% of its value, than a stock that has a 50% chance of doubling in value and a 50% chance of losing 50% of its value. 

Finally, the theory states that people are more likely to take risks when the potential reward is certain, rather than uncertain. This is because people tend to overestimate the probability of positive outcomes and underestimate the probability of negative outcomes. 

Overall, prospect theory helps to explain why people make certain decisions when faced with risk. It suggests that people are more likely to take risks when the potential reward is greater than the potential loss, when the potential reward is immediate, when the potential losses are smaller than the potential rewards, and when the potential reward is certain.
