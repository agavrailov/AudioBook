Prospect Theory of Thinking
In the 1970s, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky developed a new theory of decision-making called Prospect Theory. This theory suggests that people make decisions based on the potential gains and losses associated with a particular choice. People are more likely to take risks when the potential gains are greater than the potential losses and vice versa.

The theory proposes that people are more sensitive to losses than gains. This means that people are more likely to take risks to avoid losses than to gain something. This is known as loss aversion. People also tend to be risk-averse when the potential gains are small and the potential losses are large.

The theory also suggests that people are more likely to take risks when the potential gains are immediate and the potential losses are delayed. This is known as temporal discounting. People tend to discount the value of future losses more than future gains.

Finally, the theory proposes that people are more likely to take risks when the potential gains are certain and the potential losses are uncertain. This is known as risk aversion. People tend to be more risk-averse when the potential losses are uncertain and the potential gains are certain.

Overall, Prospect Theory suggests that people make decisions based on the potential gains and losses associated with a particular choice. People are more likely to take risks when the potential gains are greater than the potential losses and when the potential gains are immediate and certain.
