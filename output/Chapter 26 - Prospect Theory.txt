Welcome to the chapter "The Characters of the Story" of Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. 
In this chapter, Kahneman introduces two characters that represent two different systems of thinking. The first character is called System 1, which is fast, instinctive, and emotional. System 1 is responsible for automatic and effortless thinking, such as recognizing a face or understanding a joke. The second character is called System 2, which is slow, deliberate, and logical. System 2 is responsible for effortful cognitive tasks, such as solving a complex math problem or making a difficult decision. 
Kahneman explains that System 1 is the dominant character in our lives, as it is always active and is responsible for most of our decisions. System 2 is the more rational character, but it is usually inactive and is only activated when we need to focus and think deeply about something. 
Kahneman also explains that System 1 is prone to biases and errors, such as the confirmation bias and the availability heuristic. System 2 is more accurate, but it is also limited by its capacity and can be easily overwhelmed. 
Finally, Kahneman explains that the two characters can work together to make better decisions. System 1 can provide the initial intuition, while System 2 can provide the analysis and evaluation. By understanding the two characters and how they interact, we can make better decisions and avoid the pitfalls of System 1.
