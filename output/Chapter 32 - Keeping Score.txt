Welcome to Chapter 4: The Characters of the Story of Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. 
In this chapter, Kahneman introduces two characters - System 1 and System 2 - to explain how our minds work. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. It is the part of our mind that makes snap judgments and is responsible for our automatic behaviors. System 2 is slow, deliberate, and logical. It is the part of our mind that takes effort and is responsible for our conscious decisions. 
Kahneman explains that System 1 is the dominant character in our minds and is responsible for most of our decisions. System 2 is the lazy character, and it only takes over when System 1 is overwhelmed or when we make a conscious effort to think things through. 
Kahneman also explains that System 1 is prone to making errors and biases, and System 2 is responsible for correcting these errors. He argues that if we want to make better decisions, we must be aware of these errors and biases and make an effort to correct them. 
Finally, Kahneman explains that the two systems are not always in conflict. In fact, they can work together to help us make better decisions. He argues that if we can learn to recognize when System 1 is making errors and biases, and when System 2 should take over, we can make better decisions.
