Keeping Score

We all have a tendency to keep score of our successes and failures in life. This is an innate human behavior that is often overlooked, but it can have a profound impact on our lives.

In this chapter, Daniel Kahneman examines the concept of keeping score and how it affects our decision-making. He explains that when we keep score, we tend to focus on the short-term gains and losses rather than the long-term effects. This can lead to impulsive decisions that may not be in our best interest.

Kahneman also discusses the concept of "sunk costs." This is when we continue to invest in something even though the outcome is uncertain. He explains that this is a common mistake that people make when they are trying to keep score. They continue to invest in something even though they know it may not pay off in the end.

Kahneman also explains that when we keep score, we tend to focus on the immediate rewards rather than the long-term benefits. He gives the example of a person who invests in a stock that has a high potential for growth. Even though the stock may not pay off in the short term, the person may still invest in it because they are focused on the potential rewards.

Finally, Kahneman explains that keeping score can lead to a sense of entitlement. We may think that we deserve certain rewards because we have achieved certain goals. This can lead to a feeling of superiority and a lack of empathy for others.

Overall, this chapter explores the concept of keeping score and how it affects our decision-making. It explains how keeping score can lead to impulsive decisions, sunk costs, and a sense of entitlement. By understanding this concept, we can make better decisions and be more mindful of our actions.
