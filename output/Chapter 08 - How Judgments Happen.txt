Chapter How Judgments Happen

We all make judgments every day. We make decisions, form opinions, and evaluate the world around us. But how do these judgments happen? In this chapter, we'll explore the two systems of thinking that drive our judgments: System 1 and System 2. 

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. It's the part of our brain that makes snap judgments and decisions without conscious effort. System 1 is often accurate and efficient, but it can also lead to mistakes. 

System 2 is slow, deliberate, and logical. It's the part of our brain that requires effort and concentration. System 2 is more accurate than System 1, but it takes more time and energy. 

The two systems work together to help us make judgments. System 1 provides the initial impressions and intuitions, while System 2 helps us to evaluate and refine them. 

For example, when we encounter a new person, System 1 quickly forms an impression based on their appearance, mannerisms, and other cues. System 2 then evaluates the impression, considering the context and other factors. 

Sometimes, System 1 and System 2 can conflict. For example, System 1 may tell us that a certain person is untrustworthy, while System 2 may tell us that they are actually trustworthy. In this case, we must use our judgment to decide which system to trust. 

In summary, judgments are the result of both System 1 and System 2 working together. System 1 provides the initial impressions and intuitions, while System 2 evaluates and refines them. When the two systems conflict, it is up to us to decide which one to trust.
