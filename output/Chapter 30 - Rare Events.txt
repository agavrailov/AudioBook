Chapter Rare Events

Rare events are those that happen infrequently and have a major impact on our lives. In this chapter, we explore how our brains process rare events and how they can lead to irrational decisions. 

We start by looking at the concept of "availability bias". This is when we overestimate the probability of rare events because they are more easily recalled. For example, if you hear about a plane crash on the news, you may think that flying is more dangerous than it actually is. This is because the rare event is more memorable and therefore more available in your mind. 

We also look at the concept of "fear of rare events". This is when we overestimate the likelihood of a rare event because it is frightening. For example, people may overestimate the likelihood of being attacked by a shark because the idea of being attacked by a shark is so frightening. 

Finally, we look at the concept of "overconfidence". This is when we overestimate our ability to predict rare events. For example, people may think that they can predict the stock market, even though it is impossible to predict with any accuracy. 

Overall, this chapter looks at how our brains process rare events and how they can lead to irrational decisions. We explore the concepts of availability bias, fear of rare events, and overconfidence, and how they can lead us to make decisions that are not based on reality.
